        <h1>Jorge David Silva | WDD 130</h1>
        <img src="images/profile.png" alt="Hello! My name is Jorge Silva " width="200">
        <p>He was born on December 2, 1944 in Giradot, Colombia. Self-taught and with the goal of being a writer, Jorge Silva embarks
             on studies at the Luis Ángel Arango Library, where he learns about the letters of William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, 
             James Joyce, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, among others.  The film clubs in Bogotá lead Jorge Silva to a fascination with
              cinema; he meets the photographers Herman Díaz and Hernando Oliveros, whom they accompany on film shoots. Oliveros teaches
               Jorge how to use photographic equipment and the image of masters such as Robert Cappa, Henri Cartier-Bresson Brassaï, 
               Edward Steichen and Robert Frank, photographers who inspired the capture in Jorge Silva's lens. In 1964 he wrote and 
               directed his first film filmed in 16mm Los Días de Papel (1964), an autobiographical story in which he describes his life
                of poverty with the help of photography by Gilberto Ebreo, Enrique Forero and Hernando Oliveros. In 1965, Jorge met 
                Marta Rodríguez, who had recently returned from France to study film and anthropology. They decided to work together on 
                a documentary film about child exploitation in the Chircales (artisanal brick factories) in the Tunjuelito neighborhood,
                 south of Bogotá, a documentary that became a classic of New Latin American Cinema. The recognition of this work allows
                  Marta and Jorge to continue their documentary work.</p>
